      // mitigates this by creating empty missing files; thus allowing Rollup
      // to keep humming
      //
      // the race however goes like this:
      //
      // - user rename/delete page file
      // - rollup picks file change
      // - rollup triggers build
      // - rollup-plugin-hot/autocreate sees deleted file in routes.js
      // - autocreate recreates just deleted file <--- HERE BE BUG
      // - routify picks file change
      // - routify recreates routes.js
      // - ... but too late, user has extraneous deleted file recreated
      // - rollup picks the change in routes.js...
      //
      // this delay is intented to give some time to routify to pick the
      // change first (and so rollup plugin will block start of rollup build
      // until routes.js has been generated)
      //
      // we can't be too greedy, because this delay will be paid for _any_
      // file change when user is working, even when unneeded (and in this
      // case the delay will be consumed in full -- nominal case is worst
      // case) :-/

        // stil degenerate (i.e. wait full delay) for any other source watched
